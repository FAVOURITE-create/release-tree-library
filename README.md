# Release Tree Library

## Overview

Release Tree Library provides developers with a comprehensive solution for managing software releases, tracking versions, and maintaining detailed metadata across different platforms. The library offers:

- Centralized registry for digital asset releases
- Version tracking and dependency management
- Standardized metadata and tagging system
- Release capability definitions
- Flexible permissions and access control
- Cross-platform release information

## Architecture

Release Tree is built around a central registry contract that manages release metadata, versions, and cross-platform compatibility.

    E --> N[Dependency Definitions]

```

The system uses several key data structures:
- Release Registry: Stores release metadata and platform information
- Version Tracking: Manages semantic versioning and release history
- Metadata System: Defines and tracks release attributes
- Dependency Management: Handles cross-platform compatibility
- Permissions: Controls access and authorization levels

## Contract Documentation

### release-registry.clar

This is the core contract managing the Release Tree Library's functionality.

#### Key Functions

**Release Management:**
- `register-release`: Create a new release in the registry
- `update-release`: Modify existing release details
- `get-release`: Retrieve release information
- `list-releases-by-developer`: List releases by developer

**Version Tracking:**
- `create-version`: Register a new version for a release
- `update-version`: Modify version metadata
- `get-version`: Retrieve version details
- `check-version-compatibility`: Verify cross-platform compatibility

**Metadata System:**
- `register-release-category`: Define new release categories
- `set-release-tag`: Assign tags to releases
- `get-release-tag`: Retrieve release tag information

**Dependency Management:**
- `register-dependency`: Define release dependencies
- `set-release-compatibility`: Configure cross-platform rules
- `get-release-dependencies`: Check release dependencies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet
- Stacks wallet for deployment
- Understanding of semantic versioning

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
```bash
clarinet install
```
3. Test the contracts
```bash
clarinet test
```

### Basic Usage

1. Register a release:
```clarity
(contract-call? .release-registry register-release 
    "release-123" 
    "My Software" 
    (some "https://mysoftware.com") 
    "Software description")
```

2. Create a version:
```clarity
(contract-call? .release-registry create-version
    "release-123"
    "1.0.0"
    "https://artifact.url"
    u500) ;; 5% maintenance fee
```

3. Set release compatibility:
```clarity
(contract-call? .release-registry set-release-compatibility
    "release-123"
    "platform-abc"
    "{\"requirements\":\"min version 1.2.3\"}")
```

## Development

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
clarinet test
```

### Local Development

1. Start Clarinet console:
```bash
clarinet console
```

2. Deploy contracts:
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## Security Considerations

### Permissions
- Contract owner has administrative privileges
- Developers can manage their own releases
- Version creators can update metadata
- Compatibility rules require proper authorization

### Limitations
- Maximum maintenance fee is 10%
- Release IDs limited to 50 characters
- Maximum 50 versions per release
- Metadata URL length limited to 255 characters

### Best Practices
- Verify authorization before operations
- Validate all input parameters
- Use semantic versioning
- Follow standardized JSON formats
- Regular security audits recommended

A Clarity smart contract library for managing release and versioning of digital assets with robust tracking, metadata management, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Overview

GameWeave enables game developers to create interoperable NFT assets that work across multiple games and virtual environments. The platform provides:

- Centralized registry for cross-game NFT assets
- Standardized metadata and trait system
- Capability definitions for NFT functionality
- Asset conversion rules between games
- Royalty management for creators
- Flexible permissions system

## Architecture

GameWeave is built around a central registry contract that manages the relationships between games, NFTs, and their cross-game representations.

    A --> C[NFT Registry]
    A --> D[Trait System]

    E --> N[Capability Definitions]
    E --> O[NFT Capabilities]
    
    F --> P[Cross-game Mappings]
    F --> Q[Asset Translations]
```

The system uses several key data structures:
- Games Registry: Stores game metadata and developer information
- NFT Registry: Maintains core NFT data and ownership
- Trait System: Defines and tracks NFT attributes
- Capabilities: Manages what NFTs can do in different environments
- Conversion Rules: Defines how assets translate between games
